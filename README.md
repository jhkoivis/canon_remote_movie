# canon_remote_movie
minimal changes to get sample program to take movies

## Quick start

0. put camera in movie mode (see 2.) and connect USB cable, test with "EOS utility" that "remote movie" and everything else works , CLOSE eos utility
1. .exe is in Debug/CameraControl.exe
2. click "Start EVF" (you should now see liveView == "movie shoot mode for EOS 80D")
3. click "Take Movie" to start
4. click "Stop Movie" to stop

## Known "Features"

- error dialogs go behind the main window (if any errors)
- error shows just a number, see EDSDKErros.h for human readdable version

## Modifications

- PressShutterButtonCommand.h
- TakePictureCommand.h
- CameraControl.rc
- stdafx.h (here override VINVER definition and the NT-ver definition, later I found out that they are first defined in project -> properties)
- In visual studio 2017: project->properties-> C/C++ -> Genreal -> headers -> add correct path to canon sdk headers
- In visual studio 2017: project->properties-> C/C++ -> Genreal -> linker -> add correct path to canon.dll
- also, the windows kit 10 includes have to be added to headers... installing windows kit 10 and rebooting dit the trick, I think ... (complains about new.h if not correct)
  
## Depedencies etc

- Windows 10 (latest at 30.8.2019)
- win sdk kit 10 (also 8.1 is installed)
- tested with Canon eos 80D with memory card
